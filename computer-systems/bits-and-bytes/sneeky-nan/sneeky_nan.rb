# prompt: Write two functions conceal and extract,
# such that: conceal can be invoked with a short string (hint: as many as 6 bytes)
# and the returned value is and behaves identically to a NaN.
# However, invoking extract with that same value reveals the original message

# single precision floats use 64 bits (8 bytes)
# 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 52 fraction bits
# NAN is when all the exponents are "on" and ANY fraction is on.
# The exponent bits obviously all need to be on. Of the fraction bits,
# we can turn on the first one to make it a NAN. We now have 51 bits left
# to encode a message. That's 6 bytes and 3 bits, with the 3 bits as part
# of the exponent bytes. We can encode the length of the message in those
# 3 bits, and then the message in the remaining 6 bytes.

def conceal(message)
    # Force the message to be in ascii so that we can get the byte length
    # and not just the unicode length.

    # as a string and then convert it to an array of bytes

    # get the length from the lower 3 bits of the second byte
    message_length = bytes[1] & 0b111

    # we know how long the message is and that it's at the end of the bytes.
